# Travel Site 2

This is a course from Udemy titled "Git A Web Developer Job".

This course teaches you how to build websites using the modern skills, tools, and best-practices that companies need in developers.

Up your web development skills to the next level by:

* Learning **Git, GitHub, and command-line basics** to collaborate with other developers and deploy your sites live up onto the web.

* Leveraging **Node.js** tools like **NPM** and **Gulp** to save time by automating tasks.

* Enhancing your **CSS** knowledge with techniques (**BEM** & **PostCSS**) to keep your styles super-organized and manageable even on larger sites.

* Speeding up your sites with the **mobile-first performance** philosophy.

* Understanding **JavaScript** basics like **Object-oriented Programming**, and how to write well-structured code using the ES6 module pattern (**Babel** & **Webpack**).

By the end of the course, you will be able to write organized, well structured JavaScript and CSS that other developers can easily understand.
